For all designs I ask you to make, create a production-ready webpage design that is beautiful and unique—not cookie cutter. 

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Create a .env file for secrets and keys.

Replace “\&amp;\&amp;” por ";" when use sequential commands.

Try not use cd command.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Ensure your design is fully featured and worthy for production.
